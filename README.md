- I'm JM. Just a casual Arduino main.
- I love math.
- C++, HTML, and Python, The visual style code in Gamemaker (and Scratch, where it all began)
- I'm gonna become a master engineer and no one is gonna stop me! >:)
- A random teenager and student at MAPUA University
- I make shitty projects for gags (LED bread, RGB Cookies, mom detector)
- People say I'm special (needs) lmao.

My name is JM, I am a student at MAPUA University. I'm currently learning web development (something new) as a way to advance study for my college years, as well as a hobby. While web development may not be the focus of my chosen career, I think that it's cool.

When I was 12 years old, I make games on Scratch.mit.edu, my favorite one so far is a recreation of the game "Five Nights at Freddy's" by Scott Cawthon from scratch (and coded in Scratch.)
I make Arduino projects on the side as well, my favorite project is a pole dancing eraser, and a BVIP accessory to help detect obstacles for our science investigatory thesis project.

My main goal is for me to become an electrical engineer in the future! I am studying the fundamentals and elements of electricity, Arduino, and Circuit Basics.

I am interested in learning game development with Lua in the future, however, I have little experience with 3D game making.
